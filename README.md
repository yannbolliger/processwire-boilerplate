## Installing BS ProcessWire 3.x Boilerplate

- Clone this repo.

- Make a copy of `.htaccess-dev` and call it `.htaccess` in the root folder.

- Start a web server (like MAMP) and load the URL in your web browser. This will
  start the installer. See the official [Installation
  Guide](https://processwire.com/docs/install/new/) for more details and
  instructions. If you run into any trouble, please see the official
  [Troubleshooting
  Guide](https://processwire.com/docs/install/troubleshooting/).

- Choose the BS custom starter template. Disable the deletion of the
  `.gitignore` file.

- Finish!

## Enabling contact form

The contact form is already preinstalled with a customisable template. You need
to create a new contact form page (usually directly under home).

In `site/templates/scripts/main.js` uncomment the functions that handle the
contact form in order to get a nice AJAX form submission.

In `site/templates/styles/style.scss` uncomment the import at the beginning for
`@import "contact";`.

## Enabling gallery

Make a new template and use the function `renderImages` from `_func.php` to
generate the output of the thumbnails. In `site/templates/scripts/main.js`
uncomment the section for colorbox. In `site/templates/styles/style.scss`
uncomment the import at the beginning for `@import "colorbox";`.

## Debug Mode

**Warning: For this boilerplate the debug mode is on per default. Do turn it
off before deploying!**

Debug mode causes all errors to be reported to the screen, which can be
helpful during development or troubleshooting. When in the admin, it also
enables reporting of extra information in the footer. Debug mode is not
intended for live or production sites, as the information reported could
be a problem for security.

1. Edit this file: `/site/config.php`
2. Find this line: `$config->debug = false;`
3. Change the `false` to `true` and save.
